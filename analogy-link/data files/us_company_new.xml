      <description>The United States of America (USA), commonly referred to as the United States (U.S.) or America, is a federal republic composed of 50 states, a federal district, five major territories and various possessions. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is in the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The territories are scattered about the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. At 3.8 million square miles (9.842 million km2) and with over 320 million people, the country is the world's third or fourth-largest by total area and the third most populous. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States are also extremely diverse, and the country is home to a wide variety of wildlife. Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland at least 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies along the East Coast. Disputes between Great Britain and the colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with recognition of the independence of the United States by the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The country's constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787, and ratified by the states in 1788. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil liberties. Driven by the doctrine of Manifest Destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing American Indian tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states, until by 1848 the nation spanned the continent. During the second half of the 19th century, the American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of that century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy, driven in large part by the Industrial Revolution, began to soar. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country to develop nuclear weapons, the only country to use them in warfare, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 left the United States as the world's sole superpower. The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy by nominal and real GDP, benefiting from an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, the country continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. Accounting for 34% of global military spending and 23% of world GDP, it is the world's foremost military and economic power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovations.</description>

      <description>A privately held company or close corporation is a business company owned either by non-governmental organizations or by a relatively small number of shareholders or company members which does not offer or trade its company stock (shares) to the general public on the stock market exchanges, but rather the company's stock is offered, owned and traded or exchanged privately. More ambiguous terms for a privately held company are unquoted company and unlisted company. Though less visible than their publicly traded counterparts, private companies have major importance in the world's economy. In 2008, the 441 largest private companies in the United States accounted for US$1.8 trillion in revenues and employed 6.2 million people, according to Forbes. In 2005, using a substantially smaller pool size (22.7%) for comparison, the 339 companies on Forbes' survey of closely held U.S. businesses sold a trillion dollars' worth of goods and services (44%) and employed 4 million people. In 2004, the Forbes' count of privately held U.S. businesses with at least $1 billion in revenue was 305. Cargill, Koch Industries, Bechtel, Publix, Pilot Corp., Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (one of the members of the Big Four accounting firms), Hearst Corporation, Cox Enterprises, S. C. Johnson, and Mars are among the largest privately held companies in the United States. KPMG, the UK accounting firms Ernst &amp; Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers, IKEA, Trafigura, J C Bamford Excavators (JCB), Lidl, Aldi, LEGO, Bosch, Rolex, Ferrero, Bertelsmann and Victorinox are some examples of Europe's largest privately held companies.</description>

      <description>Venture capital (VC) is money that is provided to seed early-stage, emerging and emerging growth companies. Venture capital funds invest in companies in exchange for equity in the companies they invest in, which usually have a novel technology or business model in high technology industries, such as biotechnology and IT. The typical venture capital investment occurs after a seed funding round as the first round of institutional capital to fund growth (also referred to as Series A round) in the interest of generating a return through an eventual exit event, such as an IPO or trade sale of the company. Venture capital is a type of private equity. In addition to angel investing, equity crowdfunding and other seed funding options, venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering. In exchange for the high risk that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and less mature companies, venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions, in addition to a significant portion of the companies' ownership (and consequently value). Venture capital is also a way in which the private and public sectors can construct an institution that systematically creates networks for the new firms and industries, so that they can progress. This institution helps identify and combine business functions such as finance, technical expertise, marketing know-how, and business models. Once integrated, these enterprises succeed by becoming nodes in the search networks for designing and building products in their domain. However, venture capitalists' decisions are often biased, exhibiting for instance overconfidence and illusion of control, much like entrepreneurial decisions in general.</description>

      <description>In finance, private equity is an asset class consisting of equity securities and debt in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange. A private equity investment will generally be made by a private equity firm, a venture capital firm or an angel investor. Each of these categories of investor has its own set of goals, preferences and investment strategies; however, all provide working capital to a target company to nurture expansion, new-product development, or restructuring of the company’s operations, management, or ownership. Bloomberg Businessweek has called private equity a rebranding of leveraged-buyout firms after the 1980s. Common investment strategies in private equity include: leveraged buyouts, venture capital, growth capital, distressed investments and mezzanine capital. In a typical leveraged-buyout transaction, a private-equity firm buys majority control of an existing or mature firm. This is distinct from a venture-capital or growth-capital investment, in which the investors (typically venture-capital firms or angel investors) invest in young, growing or emerging companies, and rarely obtain majority control. Private equity is also often grouped into a broader category called private capital, generally used to describe capital supporting any long-term, illiquid investment strategy.</description>

      <description>California (/ˌkælᵻˈfɔːrnjə/ KAL-ə-FORN-yə, /ˌkælᵻˈfɔːrniə/ KAL-ə-FAWR-nee-ə) is the most populous state in the United States. California contains the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its seat, Los Angeles. "L.A." is the country's second largest city and is situated in Southern California. Geographically located in the western part of the U.S., the state is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east, and Arizona to the southeast. California shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south and the Pacific Ocean is on the state's western coastline. The city of Sacramento, located in Northern California, has been the state capital since 1854. What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries. It was then claimed by the Spanish Empire as part of Alta California in the larger territory of New Spain. Alta California became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican–American War. The western portion of Alta California was organized as the State of California, which was admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850. The California Gold Rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic change, with large-scale immigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom. California's diverse geography ranges from the Sierra Nevada in the east to the Pacific Coast in the west, from the redwood–Douglas fir forests of the northwest, to the Mojave Desert areas in the southeast. The center of the state is dominated by the Central Valley, a major agricultural area. California contains both the highest point (Mount Whitney) and the lowest point (Death Valley) in the contiguous United States. Earthquakes are common because of the state's location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. About 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year, but most are too small to be felt. California's economy is centered on finance, government, real estate services, technology, and professional, scientific and technical business services; together comprising 58% of the state's economy. Although only 1.5% of the state's economy, California's agriculture industry has the highest output of any U.S. state. If it were a country, California would be the 8th or 9th largest economy in the world and the 35th most populous. California has had an enormous influence on global popular culture due to being the birthplace of the film industry, the hippie counterculture, the Internet, and the personal computer.</description>

      <description>The Pacific Time Zone observes standard time by subtracting eight hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC−8). The standard time in this zone is based on the mean solar time of the 120th meridian west of the Greenwich Observatory. During daylight saving time, its time offset is UTC−7 and is thus based on the mean solar time of the 105th meridian west of the Greenwich Observatory. In the United States and Canada, this time zone is generically called the Pacific Time Zone (PT). Specifically, it uses Pacific Standard Time (PST) when observing standard time (late autumn to early spring), and Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) when observing daylight saving time (early spring to late autumn). Most of Canada uses daylight saving time. In Mexico the UTC−8 time zone is known as the Northwest Zone, which is synchronized with the U.S. PDT daylight saving schedule. The largest city in the Pacific Time Zone is Los Angeles; the city's metropolitan area is the largest in the zone. The zone is one hour ahead of the Alaska Time Zone, one hour behind the Mountain Time Zone, two hours behind the Central Time Zone, and three hours behind the Eastern Time Zone.</description>

      <description>Remote Control is the fifth album released by The Tubes. This was their first to be produced by the studio "wizard" Todd Rundgren (the other being 1985's Love Bomb). It is a concept album about a television-addicted idiot savant based on the book Being There by Jerzy Kosinski. Although Rolling Stone panned the album upon its release in 1979, calling it "drearily obvious" and "stale", two years later the same magazine loved it, limiting its praise of the subsequent album, The Completion Backward Principle, by saying, good as it was, "topping Remote Control will be difficult." Allmusic gives it four stars. Crawdaddy called it "a pop/rock masterpiece." The track Prime Time made #34 in the UK singles chart. The cover of Remote Control depicts a baby watching The Hollywood Squares in a specially made "Vidi-Trainer". The back cover is a close-up photo of the show's game board with eight members of the Tubes each sitting in different squares. The lower right corner square remained unoccupied with the band's name on the front. (Three members of the band- Waybill, Spooner and Steen- later appeared as panelists on the actual game show in the late 70s.)</description>

      <description>Robert Half is an American human resource consulting firm based in Menlo Park, California. It is a member of the S&amp;P 500, credited as being the world's first and largest accounting and finance staffing firm, with over 400 locations worldwide. In 2012, the company was ranked first in the temporary help industry on Fortune magazine's list of World's Most Admired Companies, and 9th by staffing revenue. The company was founded as the Robert Half Personnel Agency in March 1948 in New York City. Founder Robert Half had previously managed the hiring of accounting staff for a sizeable textile manufacturing concern and saw an opportunity as no placement firm was focusing on this sector of the market. In the mid-1980s, RH led the broader staffing field in moving from its prior focus on undifferentiated temporary staff for clerical and unskilled labor needs to targeting more specialized roles requiring specific training for particular industries. Having grown to over 150 locations in the United States and launched an aggressive campaign to re-purchase many of the separate franchises, the firm went public in 1987, then expanded its operations into Europe in 1993. In addition to their Accountemps brand, the firm expanded to include specialty groups focusing on technology, legal and creative services personnel. Inroads into the legal sector began with the company's 1991 acquisition of The Affiliates, a Southern California-based staffing company that focused on paralegals and other law firm support needs. Robert Half has established itself as a key information provider for government agencies and others seeking statistics and trends regarding employment, with its market-specific salary guides being used as a resource by the U.S Department of Labor in the preparation of their own forecasts. Founder Robert Half's tradition of authoring respected books on the industry (such as Making It Big in Data Processing and How to Get a Better Job in This Crazy World) has also been continued by current CEO 'Max' Messmer in the form of works like Job Hunting for Dummies. In 2003, the company was finally able to buy back the last of the few remaining independent franchise operations. In addition to their main staffing line of business, RH also provides independent risk consulting, internal audit and information technology consulting services via its Protiviti subsidiary, which was founded in 2002 with the acquisition of former employees of Arthur Andersen. Since then, the group has grown from 700 to over 2,500 staff and continues to be led by Andersen alumni.</description>

He was a pioneer of aviation psychology. During World War II Flanagan was commissioned by the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1941 to head an aviation psychology program that developed tests to help identify pilots suitable for combat missions. Flanagan was born in Armour, South Dakota on January 7, 1906, and raised in Seattle, Washington. He died on April 15, 1996 at his home in Menlo Park, California. He graduated from the University of Washington in 1929, and was the starting quarterback on the football team his senior year. He received his doctorate from Harvard University in 1934. In 1946, Flanagan founded the American Institutes for Research, a not-for-profit behavioral and social research organization that applied the Critical Incident Technique to education and other fields. In 1960 Flanagan initiated Project Talent, a massive survey of more than 400,000 high school students throughout the United States. To follow up on the needs revealed by Project Talent, Flanagan developed Project PLAN-Program for Learning in Accordance with Needs, an entire curriculum from grades one through twelve designed to meet the individual needs of all students. This was one of the earliest and most comprehensive individualized computer-assisted learning programs. Among the honors Flanagan received were: Legion of Merit by the Army Air Corps; Raymond F. Longacre Award of the Aero-Medical Association, Edward Lee Thorndike Award of the APA Division of Educational Psychology, 1976 Distinguished Professional Contribution Award of APA, Phi Delta Kappa Award for Outstanding Contributions to Education, Development and Research, ETS Award for Distinguished Service to Measurement; Professional Practice Award of APA’s Division of Industrial/Organizational Psychology.</description>

      <description>Google Inc. is an American multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products. These include online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, and software. Most of its profits are derived from AdWords, an online advertising service that places advertising near the list of search results. Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University. Together, they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004. Its mission statement from the outset was "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful," and its unofficial slogan was "Don't be evil". In 2004, Google moved to its new headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex. In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its interests as a holding company called Alphabet Inc. When this restructuring took place on October 2, 2015, Google became Alphabet's leading subsidiary, as well as the parent for Google's Internet interests. Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine (Google Search). It offers online productivity software (Google Docs) including email (Gmail), a cloud storage service (Google Drive) and a social networking service (Google+). Desktop products include applications for web browsing (Google Chrome), organizing and editing photos (Google Photos), and instant messaging (Hangouts). The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system and the browser-only Chrome OS for a class of netbooks known as Chromebooks. Google has moved increasingly into communications hardware: it partners with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its "high-quality low-cost" Nexus devices. In 2012, a fiber-optic infrastructure was installed in Kansas City to facilitate a Google Fiber broadband service. The corporation has been estimated to run more than one million servers in data centers around the world (as of 2007). It processes over one billion search requests and about 24 petabytes of user-generated data each day (as of 2009). In December 2013, Alexa listed google.com as the most visited website in the world. Numerous Google sites in other languages figure in the top one hundred, as do several other Google-owned sites such as YouTube and Blogger. Its market dominance has led to prominent media coverage, including criticism of the company over issues such as aggressive tax avoidance, search neutrality, copyright, censorship, and privacy.</description>

Be's corporate offices were located in Menlo Park, California; as well as regional sales offices in France and Japan. The company later relocated to Mountain View in California for the duration of its dissolution. The main intent of Be was to develop a new operating system using the C++ programming language on a proprietary hardware platform. The BeOS ran on the BeBox, but was later ported to Apple Computer's Power Macs despite resistance from Apple, due to the hardware specifications assistance of Power Computing. In 1998, the system was ported to the Intel x86 architecture, and PowerPC support was reduced, finally being dropped after BeOS R5.</description>

Benchmark is noted for creating the first equal ownership and compensation structure for its partners. The "maverick" firm differs from most VC firms, which are named for their founders and are structured hierarchically; Benchmark is "a lean operation in which its six full-time partners share profits equally." The firm announced in May 2012 it would be expanding beyond its Menlo Park, California headquarters by opening a second headquarters with more than 10,000 square feet in San Francisco’s emerging tech corridor, the Mid-Market neighborhood.</description>

Users of zembly interacted with one another via zembly's social networking features to engage in co-development of applications for these platforms. In addition to the development environment, the zembly platform, provided the ability to consume Web APIs (RESTful web services) in zembly applications as well as externally using the open source zembly client library (with language bindings for Java and JavaFx). This functionality provided a consistent programming model across various API providers. Zembly combined features from traditional IDEs (such as a rich scripting editor) with wiki- and social-networking-based technologies to attempt to innovate on the application development paradigm for smaller-sized applications. Applications created at zembly were automatically and transparently deployed, hosted, and scaled on its underlying cloud computing infrastructure.</description>

Its partners have been members of the founding executive teams of Silicon Valley startups of the past two decades, with each having an average of 15 years of operating experience. The firm differentiates itself from other venture capital firms in that it takes a hands-on approach with its portfolio companies, offering operational and management assistance and counsel as well as investment capital. The firm's Entrepreneur-in-Residence program takes on a select few candidates who have shown superior entrepreneurial tenacity each year. The program incubates, trains, and graduates these individuals, challenging them to apply their knowledge and experience to the mission of developing a solid business plan for an emerging technology. The firm's Young Entrepreneurs Program, now[when?] in its third year, builds relationships with top business schools nationwide to offer Foundation Capital access and exposure to promising entrepreneurs and startups through various MBA networks. Through the program, Foundation offers graduate students an opportunity to gain experience identifying promising startups, pitching ventures, providing analysis of the opportunities, and building constructive relationships. Members of the program have a background in technology or entrepreneurship, a strong interest in the field and a strong connection to the local entrepreneurship ecosystem. The firm raised its seventh and largest fund of $750 million in April 2008. It was one of Netflix's original investors.</description>

The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities and later to high-school students. Since 2006, anyone who is at least 13 years old was allowed to become a registered user of the website, though the age requirement may be higher depending on applicable local laws. Its name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students. After registering to use the site, users can create a user profile, add other users as "friends", exchange messages, post status updates and photos, share videos, use various apps and receive notifications when others update their profiles. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as "People From Work" or "Close Friends". Also users can complain or block unpleasant people. Facebook had over 1.59 billion monthly active users as of August 2015. Because of the large volume of data users submit to the service, Facebook has come under scrutiny for their privacy policies. Facebook, Inc. held its initial public offering in February 2012 and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching an original peak market capitalization of $104 billion. On July 13, 2015, Facebook became the fastest company in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index to reach a market cap of $250 billion. Following its Q3 earnings call in 2015, Facebook's market cap soared past $300 billion.</description>

      <description>The B612 Foundation is a private nonprofit foundation with headquarters in the United States, dedicated to planetary defense against asteroids and other near-Earth object (NEO) impacts. It is led mainly by scientists, former astronauts and engineers from the Institute for Advanced Study, Southwest Research Institute, Stanford University, NASA and the space industry. As a non-governmental organization it has conducted two lines of related research to help detect NEOs that could one day strike the Earth, and find the technological means to divert their path to avoid such collisions. The organization has publicized the true rate of "city-killer" type impacts of the same magnitude as the explosive 1908 Tunguska event, a rate which is from three to ten times greater than previously believed, or about every century on average. It also assisted the Association of Space Explorers in helping the United Nations establish the International Asteroid Warning Network, as well as a Space Missions Planning Advisory Group to provide oversight on proposed asteroid deflection missions. In 2012, the foundation announced it would design and build a privately financed asteroid-finding space observatory, the Sentinel Space Telescope, to be launched in 2017–2018. Once stationed in a heliocentric orbit around the Sun similar to that of Venus, Sentinel's supercooled infrared detector will help identify dangerous asteroids and other NEOs that pose a risk of collision with Earth. In the absence of substantive planetary defense provided by governments worldwide, B612 is conducting a fundraising campaign to cover the Sentinel Mission, estimated at $450 million for 10 years of operation.Fund raising has been very slow—raising only US$3 million in 2012 and 2013—and, as of June 2015, NASA is re-examining its reliance on private sector approach to space-based NEO survey missions. The B612 Foundation is named for the asteroid home of the eponymous hero of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's The Little Prince.</description>

      <speak>A component of software configuration management, version control, also known as revision control or source control, is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.</speak>

When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged. The need for a logical way to organize and control revisions has existed for almost as long as writing has existed, but revision control became much more important, and complicated, when the era of computing began. The numbering of book editions and of specification revisions are examples that date back to the print-only era. Today, the most capable (as well as complex) revision control systems are those used in software development, where a team of people may change the same files. Version control systems (VCS) most commonly run as stand-alone applications, but revision control is also embedded in various types of software such as word processors and spreadsheets, e.g., Google Docs and Sheets and in various content management systems, e.g., Wikipedia's Page history. Revision control allows for the ability to revert a document to a previous revision, which is critical for allowing editors to track each other's edits, correct mistakes, and defend against vandalism and spamming. Software tools for revision control are essential for the organization of multi-developer projects.</description>

Software developers use Subversion to maintain current and historical versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation. Its goal is to be a mostly compatible successor to the widely used Concurrent Versions System (CVS). The free software community has used Subversion widely: for example in projects such as Apache Software Foundation, Free Pascal, FreeBSD, GCC, Mono and SourceForge. CodePlex offers access to Subversion as well as to other types of clients. The corporate world has also started to adopt Subversion. A 2007 report by Forrester Research recognized Subversion as the sole leader in the Standalone Software Configuration Management (SCM) category and as a strong performer in the Software Configuration and Change Management (SCCM) category. Subversion was created by CollabNet Inc. in 2000, and is now a top-level Apache project being built and used by a global community of contributors.</description>

Git was initially designed and developed in 2005 by Linux kernel developers (including Linus Torvalds) for Linux kernel development. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server. Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.</description>

However PVCS can also be configured to support several users simultaneously attempting to edit the file; in this case the second chronological committer will have a branch created for him/her so that both modifications, instead of conflicting, will appear as parallel histories for the same file. This is unlike Concurrent Versions System (CVS) and Subversion where the second committer needs to first merge the changes via the update command and then resolve conflicts (when they exist) before actually committing. Originally developed by Don Kinzer and published by Polytron in 1985, through a history of acquisitions and mergers, the product was at times owned by Sage Software of Rockville, Maryland (unrelated to Sage Software of the UK), Intersolv, and Merant Software. The latter was acquired by Serena Software in 2004, which was then acquired by Silver Lake Partners in 2006. Synergex ported both the PVCS Version Manager and the PVCS Configuration Builder (an extended make utility, including a variant of the command line tool make[better source needed]) to various Unix platforms and OpenVMS. In 2009, Serena Software clarified that it will continue to invest in PVCS and provide support to PVCS customers for the foreseeable future.PVCS Version Manager 8.5 release (2014) introduces both new feature and new platform support.</description>

Dick Grune developed CVS as a series of shell scripts in July 1986. In addition to commercial software developers, CVS became popular with the open source software world and was released under the GNU General Public License. While there was regular development to add features and fix bugs in the past, including regular builds and test results, there have been no new releases since 2008. The product is mature: new releases are not produced until there are requests for new features or bug reports.</description>

All of Mercurial's operations are invoked as arguments to its driver program hg, a reference to the chemical symbol of the element mercury. Mercurial's major design goals include high performance and scalability, decentralized, fully distributed collaborative development, robust handling of both plain text and binary files, and advanced branching and merging capabilities, while remaining conceptually simple. It includes an integrated web interface. Mercurial has also taken steps to ease the transition for users of other version control systems, particularly Subversion. The creator and lead developer of Mercurial is Matt Mackall. Mercurial is released as free software under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 (or any later version).</description>

      <description>SourceForge is a web-based service that offers a source code repository, downloads mirrors, bug tracking and other features. It acts as a central location that software developers can use to control and manage free and open-source software development. SourceForge was one of the first to offer this service for free to open source projects[discuss]—but many users and project have now migrated to GitHub, other software hosting facilities, or self-host their software. In May 2015, SourceForge took control of pages for 5 projects that had migrated to other hosting sites and replaced the project downloads with adware-laden downloads. Community concerns have triggered a prompt review of SourceForge mirroring program and third-party bundling of mirrored content was discontinued May 27. As of March 2014, the SourceForge repository claimed to host more than 430,000 projects and had more than 3.7 million registered users. The domain sourceforge.net attracted at least 33 million visitors by August 2009 according to a Compete.com survey. Since 2012 the website runs on Apache Allura software. SourceForge offers free access to hosting and tools for developers of free / open-source software, competing with other providers such as GitHub, Bitbucket, RubyForge, Tigris.org, BountySource, Launchpad, BerliOS, JavaForge, GNU Savannah, and GitLab. On July 1, 2013, SourceForge began a beta test of a program they call DevShare, which offers projects a way to monetize their downloads by having an optional download that includes prompts for the user to download additional software that is not part of the project. Due to community reactions to the partnership program, it was revisited a few months later, but the program was ultimately opened up to all SourceForge projects on February 7, 2014. The program was cancelled by new owners BIZX in February 2016.</description>

      <description>SourceForge Enterprise Edition is a collaborative revision control and software development management system. It provides a front-end to a range of software development lifecycle services and integrates with a number of free software / open source software applications (such as PostgreSQL and Subversion). While originally itself open source software, SourceForge was commercialized as v2.5 prototype code and eventually relicensed under a proprietary software license as SourceForge Enterprise Edition. The original codebase was forked by the GNU Project as Savane. It was also later forked as GForge by one of the SourceForge programmers, and then GForge was itself forked as FusionForge by three GForge developers. Originally sold by VA Software, SourceForge Enterprise Edition was acquired by CollabNet on April 24, 2007. CollabNet subsequently integrated SourceForge Enterprise Edition with its own CollabNet Enterprise Edition and product, taking architectural and product elements from both systems, and re-launched the enhanced product as TeamForge in 2008. Since 2007, TeamForge has continued to undergo development, adding in a series of application lifecycle management tools. SourceForge.net is owned and administrated by Dice Holdings.</description>

      <description>Source Code Control System (SCCS) is an early version control system, geared toward program source code and other text files. It was originally developed in SNOBOL at Bell Labs in 1972 by Marc Rochkind for an IBM System/370 computer running OS/360 MVT. It was later rewritten by him in C for UNIX, then running on a PDP-11, and released with the Programmer's Workbench (PWB) edition of that operating system. Subsequently, SCCS was included in AT&amp;T's commercial System III and System V distributions. It was not licensed with 32V, the ancestor to Berkeley Unix. The SCCS command set is now part of the Single UNIX Specification. SCCS was the dominant version control system for Unix until later version control systems, notably the Revision Control System (RCS) and later CVS, gained more widespread adoption. Today, these early version control systems are generally considered obsolete, particularly in the open source community, which has largely embraced distributed version control systems. However, the SCCS file format is still used internally by a few newer version control programs, including BitKeeper and TeamWare. The latter is a frontend to SCCS. Sablime has been developed from a modified version of SCCS but uses a history file format that is incompatible with SCCS. The SCCS file format uses a storage technique called interleaved deltas (or the weave). This storage technique is now considered by many version control system developers as foundational to advanced merging and versioning techniques, such as the "Precise Codeville" ("pcdv") merge. Apart from fixing some Year 2000 problems in 1999, there is no active development on the various UNIX vendor specific SCCS versions.[citation needed]In 2006, Sun Microsystems (today part of Oracle Corporation) released their Solaris version of SCCS as open source under the Common Development and Distribution License as part of their efforts to open-source Solaris. SCCS is also known for the sccsid string, for example: This string contains the file name, date, and can also contain a comment. After compilation, this string can be found in binary and object files by looking for the pattern "@(#)" and can be used determine which source code files were used during compilation. The "what" command is available to automate this search for version strings.</description>

In locations where city charters are allowed by law, a city can adopt or modify its organizing charter by decision of its administration by the way established in the charter. These cities may be administered predominantly by residents or through a third-party management structure, because a charter gives a city the flexibility to choose novel types of government structure. Charter cities are similar in administrative structure to special administrative regions.</speak>

Founded in November 1999 by former Nike executives, it specializes in activewear for women, including clothing intended for use during yoga. It designs, manufactures and sells its own product lines, including items such as jackets, bras, tops, and bottoms. Initially an online-only retailer, Lucy opened brick and mortar stores in 2002 after the bursting of the dot-com bubble; for several years, the company completely shut down its web store. It was at that time the company changed its name from "Lucy.com" to "Lucy Activewear". Though based in Portland, it did not open a store there in 2002 and did not have a retail presence in Oregon until it opened stores in Portland's Pearl District and Bridgeport Village two years later. Today, Lucy has 60 stores located across the United States, primarily in California. It was headquartered out of the KOIN Center in downtown Portland. Lucy Activewear, Inc. was acquired on August 24, 2007 for $110 million by North Carolina-based VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC).</description>

      <description>Ascend Communications was an Alameda, California-based manufacturer of communications equipment that was later purchased by Lucent Technologies in 1999. Ascend Communications was founded in 1988 and taken public in 1994. Initial investors included Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield and Byers (KPCB); Greylock Partners; and New Enterprise Associates (NEA). Ascend Communications designed and manufactured equipment for high density dialup installations, most notably the MAX TNT, which allowed for a DS3 of dialup lines to be terminated in a few rack units. Customers such as AOL, Earthlink, and UUnet purchased over two million dialup ports worth of MAX TNT access servers during the dialup days of the internet. Many companies still use MAX TNT for dialup (look for TNT in dialup hostnames). In the mid-1990s, the company was one of the leading vendors of ISDN modems and concentrators. Ascend Communications also acquired several companies. The most notable of these was Cascade Communications, which Ascend acquired in 1997. Cascade designed and manufactured high density carrier packet switches, including the B-STDX9000 frame relay switch and the CBX-500 and GX-550 ATM switches. The B-STDX and CBX/GX lines were the workhorses of most RBOC Frame Relay and ATM networks throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century. In August 1998 Ascend bought Stratus Computers for $822 million in stock. Stratus was primarily a maker of fault-tolerant computer systems but it owned a Service Control Point technology critical to the convergence of voice and data networks that Ascend valued. The server business was sold off to private equity investors within months, following the Lucent deal. It now operates as Stratus Technologies. The complete product suite made Ascend an attractive asset, and was acquired by Lucent Technologies in 1999. The $24 billion merger was the largest technology merger in history up to that time. Ascend's stock traded under the Nasdaq symbol ASND.</description>

      <description>The Masonic Temple and Lodge are two adjacent Masonic buildings in downtown Alameda, California. The older Masonic Temple at 1329--31 Park St was built from 1890 to 1891. The building was designed in the Victorian Eclectic style and features brick pier which extend above the roof line, a tower on the south side of the roof, and an arched stone entrance with carved doors. The newer Masonic Lodge adjacent to the original temple at 2312 Alameda Ave is a Spanish Renaissance building constructed in 1927. The building features decorative carvings which adorn its entrances, archways, cornices, and window surrounds, and features two lodge rooms side by side, allowing both Masons and Eastern Stars to meet at the same time, as well as a full kitchen and dining room on the top floor. Lodge Room #1 features a built in wheel of stained glass emblems, allowing the room to be quickly changed from a Blue Lodge to the emblem of other frequent renters with a turn of the wheel, as well an organ loft with trap door to a Room of Contemplation, and a passage with multiple hidden doors to the lodge rooms for use in Appendant Body ceremonies. Two of the original stained glass windows from front of the Park Street face of the Masonic Temple were removed before its sale and are now displayed in Lodge Room #2 of the currently active Masonic Lodge. Oak Grove Lodge #215 (originally located in the Temple and then later moving to the Lodge) helped build the city's first school and the First Methodist Episcopal Church. Prominent members of lodges which met in the building have included U.S. congressmen Joseph R. Knowland and William Knowland, poet Joaquin Miller, and eight of Alameda's mayors. Because the name "Alameda Masonic Lodge" was already taken by #163 in Fremont, CA (the Fremont Lodge is adjacent to Alameda Creek), "Island City Masonic Lodge" is the modern name of Masonic Lodge #215 today in the city of Alameda (which continues to use the number #215 in honor of Oak Grove Lodge). The modern street entrance to the Lodge is not on Park Street, but at 2312 Alameda Ave, Alameda, CA, next to the Alameda Museum. Informal meetings are Thursday nights 6pm, with the fancier "Trestleboard" dinner the first Thursday of each month. The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.</description>

      <description>Alameda Municipal Power (formerly Alameda Power &amp; Telecom) is a municipal utility serving the City of Alameda, California. Founded in 1887, it provides electricity to approximately 34,000 residential, commercial, and municipal customers at rates up to 20 percent below neighboring communities.[citation needed] As Alameda Power &amp; Telecom, the utility previously provided Cable TV and high-speed Internet services to city residents; their system was acquired by Comcast on November 21, 2008 for $17 million. The estimated net result of this venture was a loss of more than $60 million for the City of Alameda. During 2014, 22 percent of AMP’s power mix came from renewable resources, including biomass (landfill gas) from Pittsburg, Butte, Santa Cruz and Richmond, CA; small hydroelectric from Graeagle and Central Valley CA; and winds from the High Winds Project in Sonoma County, CA. An additional 15 percent of the power mix came from large hydroelectric projects in Calaveras, Shasta, and Central Valley, CA (California does not count power from large hydroelectric dams as renewable). Altogether, AMP’s power is 37% carbon neutral in 2014.</description>

Spectrum HoloByte was founded in Boulder, Colorado but subsequently moved to Alameda, California.[citation needed] Spectrum HoloByte published games for many platforms, including home computers of the 1980s and early 1990s, IBM PC compatibles, and some video game consoles.[citation needed] The company published Solitaire Royale (1987), the first computer card solitaire program. They were the first to bring Tetris to gamers outside the Soviet Union and Sokoban to gamers outside Japan. It was also the distributor for Domark games before Domark set up its own US operations in San Mateo, California.[citation needed] In 1992 Spectrum HoloByte received an investment from Kleiner Perkins, which let the company repurchase shares formerly owned by Robert Maxwell's companies, ending its ties to their bankruptcies. In December 1993, Spectrum HoloByte merged with MicroProse to form MicroProse Inc. For the following years, games from both companies were published under their respective brands, but in 1996 all titles were consolidated under the MicroProse brand.[citation needed] Hasbro Interactive acquired the merged company in 1998, and what had been Spectrum HoloByte ceased to exist when the development studio in Alameda was closed in 1999. Hasbro subsequently[when?] sold all the assets of the various Hasbro Interactive studios to Infogrames, including the Atari brand itself.[citation needed] The chairman of Spectrum HoloByte, Gilman Louie, also founded Nexa Corporation, a developer of entertainment software, which went on to merge with Spectrum HoloByte prior to the company's move from Colorado to California.</description>

      <speak>USS Oak Ridge (ARD-19/ARDM-1), was originally an ARD-12-class floating dry dock suitable for docking destroyers, submarines and landing craft. In the early 1960s she was upgraded to support Los Angeles-class submarines, and re-classified as ARDM-1-class. Self-propelled but unable to cross the ocean under her own power, she was towed, in stages across the Pacific. While in transit she was used as a van to help move the service squadron forward and at the end of August 1944 arrived at Seeadler Harbor carrying a YTL, 2 pontoon crane barges, and 20 LCMs and LCVPs. From Manus ServRon 10 provided the logistic support for the Palau offensive, then moved itself forward to Ulithi and Kossol Roads. The Leyte landings soon followed and the repair facilities were moved up to San Pedro Bay.</speak>

      <description>USS Oak Ridge (ARD-19/ARDM-1), was originally an ARD-12-class floating dry dock suitable for docking destroyers, submarines and landing craft. In the early 1960s she was upgraded to support Los Angeles-class submarines, and re-classified as ARDM-1-class. Self-propelled but unable to cross the ocean under her own power, she was towed, in stages across the Pacific. While in transit she was used as a van to help move the service squadron forward and at the end of August 1944 arrived at Seeadler Harbor carrying a YTL, 2 pontoon crane barges, and 20 LCMs and LCVPs. From Manus ServRon 10 provided the logistic support for the Palau offensive, then moved itself forward to Ulithi and Kossol Roads. The Leyte landings soon followed and the repair facilities were moved up to San Pedro Bay. On 27 November 1944 ARD-19 was moored in that bay with USS Ross (DD-563) in dock undergoing repairs. Shortly before noon the Japanese launched an air attack. A "Tojo" fighter crashed into the drydock, passed through the starboard wingwall of the dock, and caused gasoline fed flames to encompass the dock basin deck, searing Ross as they spread. As the fire was being contained another Japanese fighter commenced a strafing run, but was splashed by gunfire from the ARD, Ross, and LST-556. Heavy damage kept the ARD busy on self-repairs for only a brief time. She soon resumed her drydocking and repair role, and continued that service, at Subic Bay, Luzon, until after the end of World War II. In 1948, ARD-19 was towed back across the Pacific and on 29 October she reported for duty with the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Long Beach. For the next six months she operated under that command and ServRon 1, carrying district craft to various berthing areas on the west coast. In March 1949 she carried YFN–599 to Puget Sound, took on cranes and got underway, in tow, for the Panama Canal Zone. From the Canal Zone she continued on to Orange, Texas, with more district craft in her dock basin. Arriving 10 June, she continued her ferry service until decommissioned and assigned to the Texas Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet for berthing, 30 September 1949. Thirteen years later, September 1962, ARD-19 was brought out of reserve and taken to Jacksonville, Florida, where she was converted, by the Gibbs Shipyards to a fleet Los Angeles-class "fast attack" submarine drydock. Her length increased to 536’1” and her displacement to 9,700 tons, she became the first mobile single unit capable of such docking. She was then named, redesignated, and recommissioned as Oak Ridge (ARDM-1), 1 October 1963. Further changes, such as the replacement of two 10-ton cranes with two 25-ton cranes, kept her at Norfolk until 4 June 1964 when she was taken under tow by Atakapa to begin the long journey to her homeport of Rota, Spain. With USS Mahoa (YTM-519) in her dock basin, she arrived at Rota 22 days later and commenced providing the services, to Polaris-equipped submarines and others as required, which she continued into 1970. Oak Ridge was decommissioned on 10 August 2001, stricken from the Naval register on 26 November 2001, and transferred to the United States Coast Guard on 8 February 2002. Her last station was at the Groton, Connecticut submarine base.</description>

Born in Alameda, California, he stood 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) tall and weighed 170 pounds (77 kg) as an active player.Macdonald signed his first professional contract with the Detroit Tigers and spent 1947–1948 in their farm system. After winning 15 games during the latter season for the Flint Arrows of the Class A Central League, Macdonald was declared a free agent by Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler on October 27, 1948; three months later, he signed with the New Orleans Pelicans, the Pirate affiliate in the Double-A Southern Association. In 1949, he posted a 13–11 record with the Pelicans and made the Pirates' roster out of spring training in 1950. As a rookie, he appeared in 32 games, twenty as a starting pitcher, and won eight of 18 decisions, with six complete games and two shutouts. In his second MLB game, on May 23, he threw a complete game, three-hitter and blanked the eventual National League champion Philadelphia Phillies, 6–0 at Shibe Park. Macdonald missed the entire 1951–1952 seasons due to military service. When he returned to baseball in 1953, he pitched ineffectively for the Pirates during the season's early weeks and spent much of the campaign with the Hollywood Stars of the Open-Classification Pacific Coast League. He left baseball after the 1954 minor league season. All told, in 160⅓ Major League innings pitched, Macdonald gave up 150 hits and 96 bases on balls; he struck out 64.</description>

They store current and historical data and are used for creating analytical reports for knowledge workers throughout the enterprise. Examples of reports could range from annual and quarterly comparisons and trends to detailed daily sales analysis. The data stored in the warehouse is uploaded from the operational systems (such as marketing, sales, etc., shown in the figure to the right). The data may pass through an operational data store for additional operations before it is used in the DW for reporting.</description>

      <description>A database is an organized collection of data. It is the collection of schemas, tables, queries, reports, views and other objects.The data are typically organized to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as modelling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies. A database management system (DBMS) is a computer software application that interacts with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases. Well-known DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Sybase and IBM DB2. A database is not generally portable across different DBMSs, but different DBMS can interoperate by using standards such as SQL and ODBC or JDBC to allow a single application to work with more than one DBMS. Database management systems are often classified according to the database model that they support; the most popular database systems since the 1980s have all supported the relational model as represented by the SQL language.[disputed – discuss] Sometimes a DBMS is loosely referred to as a 'database'.</description>

Such organizations would include businesses, schools, interest-based user groups, clubs, charities, or governments. Enterprise software is an integral part of a (computer based) Information System. Services provided by enterprise software are typically business-oriented tools such as online shopping and online payment processing, interactive product catalogue, automated billing systems, security, enterprise content management, IT service management, customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning, business intelligence, project management, collaboration, human resource management, manufacturing, enterprise application integration, and enterprise forms automation. As enterprises have similar departments and systems in common, enterprise software is often available as a suite of customizable programs. Generally, the complexity of these tools requires specialist capabilities and specific knowledge.</description>

      <description>The Hewlett-Packard Company (commonly referred to as HP) was an American global information technology company headquartered in Palo Alto, California. It developed and provided a wide variety of hardware components as well as software and related services to consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors. The company was founded in a one-car garage in Palo Alto by William "Bill" Redington Hewlett and David "Dave" Packard starting with a line of electronic test equipment. HP was the world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 to Q2 2013, after which Lenovo remained ranked ahead of HP. It specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage, and networking hardware, designing software and delivering services. Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking products, software and a diverse range of printers and other imaging products. HP marketed its products to households, small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises directly as well as via online distribution, consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers, software partners and major technology vendors. HP also had services and consulting business around its products and partner products. Hewlett-Packard company events included the spin-off of its electronic and bio-analytical measurement instruments part of its business as Agilent Technologies in 1999, its merger with Compaq in 2002, and the acquisition of EDS in 2008, which led to combined revenues of $118.4 billion in 2008 and a Fortune 500 ranking of 9 in 2009. In November 2009, HP announced the acquisition of 3Com, with the deal closing on April 12, 2010. On April 28, 2010, HP announced the buyout of Palm, Inc. for $1.2 billion. On September 2, 2010, HP won its bidding war for 3PAR with a $33 a share offer ($2.07 billion), which Dell declined to match. On October 6, 2014, Hewlett-Packard announced plans to split the PC and printers business from its enterprise products and services business. The split closed on November 1, 2015 and resulted in two publicly traded companies: HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.</description>

During the first Sunday in November, at 2:00 a.m. EDT, clocks are moved back to 1:00 a.m. EST, thus "duplicating" one hour. Southern parts of the zone (Panama and the Caribbean) do not observe daylight saving time.</description>

      <description>Massachusetts /ˌmæsəˈtʃuːsᵻts/, officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north and New York to the west. The capital of Massachusetts and the largest city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metro area, a region influential to American history and industry. Boston-Logan International Airport is New England's busiest airport. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Contemporary Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, finance, higher education and maritime trade. The entire Commonwealth has played a powerful commercial and cultural role in the history of the country. Plymouth was the site of the first colony in New England, founded in 1620 by the Pilgrims, passengers of the Mayflower. Harvard University, located in Cambridge, is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. In 1692, the town of Salem and surrounding areas experienced one of America's most infamous cases of mass hysteria, the Salem witch trials. In the 18th century, the Protestant First Great Awakening, which swept the Atlantic world, originated from the pulpit of Northampton preacher Jonathan Edwards. In the late 18th century, Boston became known as the "Cradle of Liberty" for the agitation there that led to the American Revolution. In 1777, General Henry Knox founded the Springfield Armory, which during the Industrial Revolution catalyzed numerous important technological advances, including interchangeable parts. In 1786, Shays' Rebellion, a populist revolt led by disaffected Revolutionary War veterans, influenced the United States Constitutional Convention. Before the American Civil War, Massachusetts was a center for the abolitionist, temperance and transcendentalist movements. In the late 19th century, the sports of basketball and volleyball were invented in the western Massachusetts cities of Springfield and Holyoke, respectively. In 2004, Massachusetts became the first U.S. state to legally recognize same-sex marriage as a result of the decision of the state's Supreme Judicial Court. Many prominent American political dynasties have hailed from the state, including the Adams and Kennedy families.</description>

Middlesex County is included in the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county government was abolished in 1997, but the county boundaries continue to describe a state district for court jurisdictions and for other administrative purposes, such as an indicator for elections. Massachusetts counties also define locations for National Weather Service weather alerts (such as severe thunderstorm warnings). In 2010, the center of population of Massachusetts was located in Middlesex County, in the town of Natick.</description>

Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. Researchers worked on computers, radar, and inertial guidance during World War II and the Cold War. Post-war defense research contributed to the rapid expansion of the faculty and campus under James Killian. The current 168-acre (68.0 ha) campus opened in 1916 and extends over 1 mile (1.6 km) along the northern bank of the Charles River basin. MIT, with five schools and one college which contain a total of 32 departments, is often cited as among the world's top universities. The Institute is traditionally known for its research and education in the physical sciences and engineering, and more recently in biology, economics, linguistics, and management as well. The "Engineers" sponsor 31 sports, most teams of which compete in the NCAA Division III's New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference; the Division I rowing programs compete as part of the EARC and EAWRC. As of 2015, 85 Nobel laureates, 52 National Medal of Science recipients, 65 Marshall Scholars, 45 Rhodes Scholars, 38 MacArthur Fellows, 34 astronauts, and 2 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT. The school has a strong entrepreneurial culture, and the aggregated revenues of companies founded by MIT alumni would rank as the eleventh-largest economy in the world.</description>

Whalen played college football at Boston College and was selected in the third round of the 1965 AFL Draft. He was also drafted in the fourth round of the 1965 NFL Draft by the Minnesota Vikings. Jim Whalen is the only football player to have 3 TD receptions in a college game played at Boston College Alumni Stadium and have 3 TD receptions in a professional football game played at Boston College Alumni Stadium.[citation needed] Jim caught 3 TD passes for the Boston Patriots in their 41-10 rout of the Miami Dolphins at BC on October 15, 1967. The Boston Red Sox were playing in the 1967 World Series and the Patriots had to play at Boston College for this game.[citation needed] Earlier in 1962 as a sophomore at Boston College, Whalen hauled in three touchdown receptions in a victory against Boston University. Early Years: James Francis "Jim" Whalen Jr. grew up in Cambridge, MA residing on Plymouth Street, the son of James Francis "Brud" Whalen and Helen Whalen, née Zukowski. He has one sister Rosemary.(2)(3)(4)(5). The younger Whalen was a three-sport star at Cambridge Rindge and Latin, Cambridge, MA, a school that also produced a number of other top athletes including MLB Hall-of-Fame pitcher and 342 game winner Tim Keefe, MLB player Eddie Waitkus on whom the movie The Natural was loosely based and Olympic high jumper John Thomas. Whalen, who starred in football, baseball and ice hockey, was subsequently inducted into the Cambridge Rindge and Latin Athletic Hall of Fame.(2)(3)(4)(5)(6) College Years: One of the finest pass catchers and all-around athletes to graduate from Boston College. At the time of his graduation after the 1964 season, Whalen was the top pass receiver in Boston College history with 73 career receptions, surpassing the total of 70 accumulated by Art Graham,(7)(8) who like Whalen a few years later, would go on to a stellar career with the Boston Patriots.(1) In addition to being one of the top ends in the country, Whalen was called upon to also punt his senior season.(9) During his tenure at BC, Whalen also lettered in baseball and ice hockey in addition to football.(4)(5)(7) The 1963, 1964 and 1965 BC Eagles hockey teams won the Beanpot Tournament while the 1963 and 1965 teams each reached the national Frozen Four. Like his dad who was elected into the Manhattan College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1989,(10) so too the younger Whalen himself would be so honored by being elected into the Boston College Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 1995.(7) [Note: James "Brud" Whalen was one of the preeminent multi-sport collegiate stars of his era captaining the Manhattan College baseball and football teams in its sports heyday at the national level. In one of his seasons on the gridiron he averaged 9.1 yards per carry rushing, 12.7 yards per pass reception, 45 yards per punt return and was among the leaders nationally in touchdowns scored].(10)(11)(18) 1962 Season: Started as a sophomore at Boston College recording 16 catches for 309 yards and a lofty 19.3 yards per reception.(7)(9) Was second on the team in touchdowns with six, trailing only Art Graham who scored seven.(7)(9) Boston College would finish with an 8-2 record including wins over Texas Tech, Vanderbilt and Houston.(7)(9) 1963 Season: Consensus First Team All-East selection as offensive end.(7)(12) Ranked first nationally in yards per catch (minimum of 25 catches) with an everage of 20.1.(13) His 523 receiving yards on 26 catches ranked eighth nationally,only 36 yards out of the fourth position.(13) In addition to leading BC in receiving yards, Whalen also led in receptions.(7)(9) Boston College finished with a 6-3 record including wins over Virginia and Vanderbilt.(9) 1964 Season: Repeated as consensus First Team All-East.(7) Joining Whalen at the offensive skill positions were Roger Staubach/Navy at QB, Milt Moran/UMass at end, and Jim Nance and Floyd Little, each of Syracuse, as backs.(14) After the conclusion of the 1964 season, Whalen was selected as a starter in both the East - West Shrine Game (held in San Francisco), as well as the Senior Bowl (Mobile, Alabama).(4)(5)(7) Whalen recorded 31 catches and 398 receiving yards, leading the team in both categories.(7)(9) He was also one of three primary punters that season leading the squad with nearly 35 yards per kick.(9) Boston College finished 6-3 including wins over #9 ranked Syracuse and Cincinnati which would finish 8-2 that season.(9) Against Air Force, Whalen's 4th down 30 yard touchdown reception on an Ed Foley pass snapped a 7-7 tie leading to a 13-7 win.(15) Later that season, Whalen's 15 yard catch in the closing moments resulted in a 10-8 victory in Holy Cross Coach Eddie Anderson's final game. At the time, Anderson's 201 wins (against 128 losses and 15 ties) ranked fourth behind only Pop Warner, Amos Stagg and Jess Neely.(16) Professional Career: Unlike his dad who turned down offers from both professional football and Major League Baseball,(2)(10)(17)(18)(19) the younger Whalen decided to take his athletic talents to the professional level. Although being recruited by teams from the National Hockey League as well as from others in Major League Baseball, Whalen chose football and signed with the hometown Boston Patriots who had drafted him with the 23rd overall pick [note: The younger Whalen was also drafted by the Minnesota Vikings].(1)(2)(4)(5) 1965 Season: Recorded 22 catches and 381 receiving yards, each of which ranked eleventh among combined AFL + NFL tight ends.(1) On October 24, 1965, Whalen recorded his first professional 100 yard receiving game (109 yards) against the Oakland Raiders.(1) Patriots finish the season with a 4-8-2 record. (1) 1966 Season: Recorded 29 catches for 502 receiving yards ranking ninth among all tight ends in the combined AFL + NFL.(1) His four receiving touchdowns ranked first among AFL tight ends and fourth overall trailing only John Mackey, Jerry Smith and Pete Retzlaff.(1) On November 13, 1966, Whalen scored his first professional touchdown on a 42 yard pass reception from Babe Parilli in a 27-21 win over the Houston Oilers.(1) He would then proceed to score three more touchdowns over the next five games.(1) The First Team All-Pro tight ends in 1966 were Fred Arbanas (22 catches, 305 yards and 4 touchdowns) and John Mackey (50, 829 and 9). (1) Patriots finish 8-4-2. 1967 Season: Recorded 39 catches for 651 yards, each ranking seventh among combined AFL + NFL tight ends.(1) His five receiving touchdowns as a tight end ranked second in the AFL and fourth in the combined AFL + NFL.(1) Whalen's 651 receiving yards was tops among all Patriot receivers, ahead of the 606 recorded by WR Art Graham and 502 by RB Larry Garron, and his five receiving touchdowns also topped the squad.(1) On October 15, 1967, Whalen tied the Patriots record of three touchdowns in a single game during a 41-10 thrashing of the Miami Dolphins.(1) The three receiving touchdowns while subsequently surpassed by WR Randy Moss on November 18, 2007 against Buffalo, is through the 2012 season still a Patriots record for tight ends.(1) The First Team All-Pro tight ends were Billy Cannon (32, 629 and 10) and John Mackey (55, 686 and 3). (1) Patriots finish 3-10-1. 1968 Season: Recorded 47 catches and seven touchdowns as a tight end, each leading the AFL and ranking second among all AFL + NFL tight ends [Note: Jackie Smith led the NFL with 49 receptions].(1) Whalen also piled up 718 receiving yards ranking second among AFL tight ends and fourth across the combined AFL + NFL.(1) No other Patriot tallied more than 19 receptions or 331 yards receiving.(1) Whalen's 87 yard pass reception on a Tom Sherman pass (October 27, 1968) against the Super Bowl-bound (and winning) New York Jets was at the time the longest play from scrimmage in Patriots history.(1) Through the 2012 season it still remains as the longest reception by a tight end in Patriots history, and also one of the longest by a tight end in professional football history.(1) On September 22, 1968 the Boston Patriots and New York Jets played the first professional football ever held in the state of Alabama. (1) The Patriots at the time did not have a permanent home stadium and with a possible eye to relocation, played a "home game" at Legion Field in Birmingham, in part to capitalize on the popularity of Jets quarterback Joe Namath who played his college football at the University of Alabama. The Jets would go on to defeat the Patriots 47-31, despite Whalen's game high 6 receptions (George Sauer led the Jets with 5 catches).(1) After a 20-17 victory against the Denver Broncos (September 29, 1968) in which Whalen caught four balls including one for a touchdown, he was awarded a game ball by his teammates.(1)(20) Ironically two years later, Whalen would be playing for the Broncos.(1) Had a career game high eight receptions against the Oakland Raiders on October 6, 1968.(1) Also during the season, Whalen would have two multiple touchdown games in a pair of wins against the Buffalo Bills (October 20, 1968 with Mike Taliaferro at QB) and the Cincinnati Bengals (December 1, 1968 with Tom Sherman at QB).(1) It would be over 25 years until another Patriot tight end, Ben Coates, would exceed both Whalen's receptions per scheduled game and receiving yardage per scheduled game when the former combined with QB Drew Bledsoe in 1994 to set a new NFL record for tight ends.(1) Additionally during the 1968 season, Whalen led the Patriots in both touchdowns (7) and total yards from scrimmage (718).(1) This was the first of only two seasons in Patriots history through 2012 that a tight end would lead the club in yards from scrimmage—the second coming in 1994 during Ben Coates record-setting season.(1) Whalen is named Patriots team MVP by the 1776 Booster's Club.(21) For his accomplishments in 1968, Whalen would be accorded First Team All-Pro, marking the first time that any Patriots receiver, tight end or otherwise, would be selected First Team All-Pro.(1) The other All-Pro tight end that season was John Mackey (45, 644 and 5). (1) Patriots finish 4-10. 1969 Season: In a season during which he was battling influenza, Whalen recorded 16 receptions for 235 yards and a touchdown in a year in which no Patriot (running backs included) caught more than 29 balls.(1)(24) On September 28, 1969 in a loss against the Oakland Raiders, Whalen scores his last touchdown as a Patriot.(1) After the season, Whalen was traded to the Denver Broncos for another tight end, Tom Beer, who would subsequently write a book entitled Sunday's Fools about his days in football. Patriots finish 4-10. 1970 Season: In his first season as a Denver Bronco, Whalen records 36 receptions for 503 yards and three touchdowns ranking in the top ten in each category across all NFL tight ends.(1) In a 24-10 victory over the Atlanta Falcons on October 18, 1970, Whalen scores his first touchdown as a Denver Bronco on an 8 yard pass from QB Pete Liske.(1) A month later on November 22, 1970, Whalen scores his last NFL touchdown during a 31-6 win over the New Orleans Saints.(1) The First Team All-Pro tight end is Charlie Sanders who records 40 catches, 544 receiving yards and 6 touchdowns. Placing second in the All-Pro voting for tight ends that season is Bob Trumpy (29, 480 and 2). (1) 1971 Season: As a Denver Bronco, Whalen pulls in a game-high 4 passes for 53 yards in a loss to the Green Bay Packers followed by 3 more catches and a game-high 71 yards from scrimmage the next week in a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.(1) He soon thereafter moves in-season to the Philadelphia Eagles for whom he hauls in a 41 yard pass against the Washington Redskins before retiring.(1) Historical Perspective: Despite playing his entire career during the shorter 14-game season and largely for teams that ranked at or near the bottom in passing,(1) Whalen's accomplishments still compare favorably in today's offense-oriented game. He is one of only four Patriot tight ends (Russ Francis, Ben Coates and Rob Gronkowski) to string together three consecutive seasons of 500+ yards receiving (he had another with the Denver Broncos),(1) and one of only three (Coates, Gronkowski) to record 650+ yards in back-to-back seasons.(1) Additionally, Whalen's Patriot career yards per reception average of 16.3 ranks first among all Patriot tight ends (1)(22) and sixth all-time among all Patriot receivers, wide outs included (minimum of 150 career receptions).(1)(22) His career average of 16.0 per catch (inclusive of his time with the Denver Broncos and Philadelphia Eagles) as a tight end is outstanding and ranks in the top ten in the history of professional football (minimum of 150 receptions).(1) Five of Whalen's 20 career touchdowns were for 40 or more yards.(1) Whalen through 2013 still also holds Patriots tight end records for longest reception (87 yards), longest touchdown reception (87 yards) and most touchdown receptions in a single game (3). (1) Furthermore, Whalen protected the ball exceptionally well, fumbling just twice in his career.(1) Through the end of the 2010 season, only one tight end in history (Andrew Glover) had fewer career fumbles than Whalen while catching as many passes.(1) Had a career game high of 134 yards receiving (against the Miami Dolphins in 1967),(1) and is one of only five Patriot tight ends (Coates, Hasselbeck, Gronkowski and Hernandez) to record at least four career 100 yard receiving games.(1) Whalen's accomplishments also compare favorably to those of his peers during his time in professional football. The All AFL Hall-Of-Fame First Team All-1960's Team tight end is Fred Arbanas. Catching passes from Hall-Of-Fame quarterback Len Dawson, Arbanas caught 198 balls for 3,101 yards, a career 15.7 yards per catch average, 34 touchdowns while fumbling 4 times in 118 games. (1) Whalen's career line is 197 catches for 3,155 yards, a career 16.0 yards per catch average, 20 touchdowns while fumbling twice in 89 games. (1). During his career, Whalen caught touchdown passes from Babe Parilli, Don Trull, Mike Taliferro, Tom Sherman and Pete Liske. (1) He also lined up with Steve Tensi, Alan Pastrana, Steve Ramsey and Don Horn in the quarterback position.

Somerby (1832–1903) was an entertainer, showman, and panoramist in the mid-nineteenth century, and one of a very few men of his profession to leave behind any memoirs or account of his activities. He is chiefly known through a series of articles published in 1903 and 1904 in The Billboard, the ancestor of today's "Billboard Magazine," which at the time was a trade journal for circus, carnival, and theatrical performers and managers. Somerby operated several moving panoramas under the management of Boston's George K. Goodwin, including a panorama of "Dr. Kane's Arctic Voyages," and also was involved in mechanical theatres. He worked as an agent for P.T. Barnum, bringing one such mechanical theatre, "Thiodon's Theatre of Arts," from the United Kingdom to the United States for an exhibition at Barnum's American Museum. Later, after this mechanical show was completed his run, he oversaw its re-making into two smaller such theatres, one of which had its figures re-painted to as to present not "The Battle of Balaclava" in the Crimean War, but the assault on Fort Sumter, by a panorama broker in Providence, Rhode Island. Somerby may possibly have served in the U.S. Civil War; a man of that name was a lieutenant in both Companies "A" and "B" of the Ninth Kentucky Infantry Regiment. In any case, after the war he returned to the show trade, working with the well-known Boston actor and theatrical agent, Edward P. Kendall as part of a variety troupe, established in 1867, which toured the country. Other members of this troupe included John Maguire, Barney McNulty, C. Amory Bruce, L. M. W. Steere and D. B. Hodges. Somerby also headed his own bills as a professional lecturer; in 1877, there is a record of his operating his own Fair, which included himself as "graphic lecturer" (probably with a panorama), O-car Shaffer, a "facial contortionist," Shaffer's wife the singer Louise Shaffer, and a player of the "musical glasses" (probably a sort of glass harmonica).</description>

      <description>The Harvard Institute of Politics (IOP) was created to serve as a living memorial to President John F. Kennedy and inspire Harvard University students into careers in politics and public service, much as President Kennedy was inspired during his days as a student at Harvard. The IOP also brings together the academic world with the world of politics and public affairs. All of this activity occurs on a non-partisan basis with the sole aim of promoting public service. Following President Kennedy's death in 1963, the Kennedy Library Corporation raised more than $20 million for both the construction of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, and for the creation and endowment of an institute at Harvard for the study of politics and public affairs. More than 30 million people from around the world, including school children, contributed to the fund. In 1966, the Kennedy Library Corporation presented Harvard University with an endowment for the creation of the Institute of Politics. On January 31, 2011, former Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson became the IOP director with previous interim director John C. Culver assuming the title of director emeritus. The IOP also has a full-time staff, an advisory committee of Harvard students, and an advisory board including Caroline Kennedy, former US Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, former Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE), former Senator John Culver (D-IA) and Congressman William Delahunt (D-MA), former White House Chief of Staff Kenneth Duberstein, former congressman Phil Sharp (D-IN), PBS correspondent Gwen Ifill, New York Times executive Rick Berke, and former advisor to President Kennedy Milton Gwirtzman. Among the programs offered by the IOP include internships, prominent and diverse Forum speakers, the Harvard Political Review, study groups led by visiting and resident Fellows, annual public opinion surveys focused on America's youth, policy groups, and conferences intended to provide opportunities for interaction with the people who shape politics and public policy. The IOP does not offer formal courses or degree-granting programs; instead, it provides avenues for practical experience and encourages students to examine critically and think creatively about politics and public issues. In 2003, the IOP launched the National Campaign for Political and Civic Engagement, working collaboratively with other schools and organizations across the country to engage young people. The IOP also conducts research and surveys into the political views of America's young voters. In addition, the Institute offers conferences for new members of Congress and new mayors, and, after each Presidential election since 1972, brings together top campaign officials to analyze the race in the "Campaign for President" series. The Institute of Politics is housed within Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, and is affiliated with the Kennedy Presidential Library. The three institutions work closely together.</description>

In 1815, Sewall was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. He was dismissed from his office as solicitor general in 1816 after it was revealed that he had submitted documents published in the Montreal Herald that were critical of Governor George Prevost's administration. Sewell was named King's Counsel in 1827. He served as a commissioner during the construction of the Lachine Canal. Sewell helped found the Natural History Society of Montreal and served as its president. He was the first president of the Montreal bar library and also served as solicitor for the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning during the transfer of that part of James McGill's property which became the site of McGill College.

      <description>Kelvin Norman is a deceased American soccer defender who played in the North American Soccer League, Major Indoor Soccer League and SISL. He was the 1989 Southwest Outdoor Soccer League MVP and coached the Colorado Comets in the SISL and USISL. In 1978, Norman signed with the Portland Timbers of the North American Soccer League. He spent two seasons with the Timbers, largely in the reserves. In the fall of 1979, he moved to the New England Tea Men where he saw time in three games during the NASL indoor season. He then moved to the Denver Avalanche of the Major Indoor Soccer League. He played two seasons with Denver, then finished with one season with the Los Angeles Lazers. Norman then became the head coach of the amateur Colorado Comets. In 1989, the Comets entered, and won, the Southwest Outdoor Soccer League under the direction of Ed Eid. Norman spent that season as a player-assistant coach and was named the 1989 SOSL Most Valuable Player. On November 8, 2005, Norman was killed when Jason Reynolds, in a fit of rage, cut off Norman then braked suddenly when Norman was driving on E-470. Norman lost control of his vehicle which crossed into on-coming traffic, flipped and landed on a Ford Explorer, killing both Norman and the driver of the Ford. Reynolds received two life sentences for the deaths. The Colorado Rapids Youth Soccer Club holds an annual Kelvin Norman Memorial Soccer Tournament.</description>

      <description>Harvard University is a private Ivy League research university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, established 1636, whose history, influence and wealth have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world. Established originally by the Massachusetts legislature and soon thereafter named for John Harvard (its first benefactor), Harvard is the United States' oldest institution of higher learning, and the Harvard Corporation (formally, the President and Fellows of Harvard College) is its first chartered corporation. Although never formally affiliated with any denomination, the early College primarily trained Congregationalist and Unitarian clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900. James Bryant Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II and began to reform the curriculum and liberalize admissions after the war. The undergraduate college became coeducational after its 1977 merger with Radcliffe College. The University is organized into eleven separate academic units—ten faculties and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study—with campuses throughout the Boston metropolitan area: its 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard in Cambridge, approximately 3 miles (5 km) northwest of Boston; the business school and athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston and the medical, dental, and public health schools are in the Longwood Medical Area. Harvard has the largest financial endowment of any academic institution in the world, standing at $36.4 billion. Harvard is a large, highly residential research university. The nominal cost of attendance is high, but the University's large endowment allows it to offer generous financial aid packages. It operates several arts, cultural, and scientific museums, alongside the Harvard Library, which is the world's largest academic and private library system, comprising 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes. Harvard's alumni include eight U.S. presidents, several foreign heads of state, 62 living billionaires, 335 Rhodes Scholars, and 242 Marshall Scholars. To date, some 150 Nobel laureates and 5 Fields Medalists (when awarded) have been affiliated as students, faculty, or staff.</description>

      <description>The Harvard–MIT Program of Health Sciences and Technology , or HST, is one of the oldest and largest biomedical engineering and physician-scientist training programs in the United States. It was founded in 1970 and is the longest-standing functional collaboration between Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). HST's unique interdisciplinary educational program brings engineering as well as the physical and biological sciences from the scientist's bench to the patient's bedside. Conversely, it brings clinical insight from the patient's bedside to the laboratory bench. In this way, HST students are trained to have deep understanding of engineering, physical sciences, and the biological sciences, complemented with hands-on experience in the clinic or in industry; and they become conversant with the underlying quantitative and molecular aspects of medicine and biomedical science. Within the division, more than 300 graduate students work with eminent faculty and affiliated faculty members from throughout the MIT and Harvard communities. HST is also the home of the Laboratory of Computational Physiology (LCP) which hosts the MIMIC II database and PhysioNet. In addition to its outstanding record of accomplishment for research in human health care, HST educational programs are distinguished by three key elements: HST is a part of MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and 1 of 5 societies at Harvard Medical School.</description>

Milkie (October 1968 to October 1969), Kevin P. Brown (November 1969 to December 1970), and Steven Glines (January 1971 to February 1972); and Art Director Thomas T. Milkie (November and December 1969). The magazine was published by Model Rocketry, Inc., a closely held corporation owned by founding staff members George J. Flynn, Gordon K. Mandell, George J. Caporaso, and Thomas T. Milkie and members of their families. Its paid circulation reached 15,000 by 1970. The launch of Sputnik in 1957 and the space race to the moon made model rocketry a popular hobby. Model Rocketry magazine was started at the height of the Apollo program. Each issue had plans and instructions for constructing rockets typically powered by black powder rocket motors such as those made by Estes Industries. There were also technical articles on model rocket design that would include several pages of theory and equations. There was a series of articles starting in October 1969 on writing FORTRAN programs to calculate flight parameters. The magazine also covered model rocketry clubs' launch meets and contests. From August 1969 to February 1972 Model Rocketry incorporated The Model Rocketeer, the official journal of the National Association of Rocketry. The September 1969 issue of Model Rocketry shown at the right has a typical cover design and contents. The cover photo shows the launch of a model rocket approximately 2 feet (61 cm) tall with a small camera as the payload. The camera will take a photo after the rocket reaches its apogee and starts its descent with a parachute. This issue also has construction plans for an egg lofting rocket, a type of rocket used in competitions to see how high an egg could be launched and recovered without cracking. The topics on the cover include Apollo 11 and the issue includes a 6 page article by the Managing Editor, Gordon Mandell, about the first manned mission to land on the moon.</description>

The Episcopal Divinity School offers Master of Divinity, Master of Arts in Theological Studies, and Doctor of Ministry degrees, as well as a Certificate in Anglican Studies. It has a longtime relationship with Harvard Divinity School that includes cross-registration. The Episcopal Divinity School is a member of the Boston Theological Institute, a consortium of nine Boston-area seminaries and divinity schools that share library and academic resources and allow cross-registration for courses. Since 2010, EDS has shared part of its campus, offered cross-registration, and pooled resources with Lesley University. Established to train people for ordination in the Episcopal Church, the seminary also trains students from other denominations; since 2011, members of the Metropolitan Community Church can train for ordination in their church, receiving specific instruction on their church's polity. Known throughout the Anglican Communion for progressive teaching and action on issues of civil rights and social justice, its faculty and students have been directly involved in many of the social controversies surrounding the Episcopal Church in the latter half of the 20th century and at the start of the 21st.</description>

      <description>Francis Oliver "Fran" Matthews (November 2, 1916 – August 24, 1999) was a baseball first baseman in the Negro Leagues. Matthews was born and raised in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he attended the prestigious Rindge Technical School. By the time he graduated in 1935, Matthews ability as one of the best baseball players in the Greater Boston area led to him being recognized as the first black captain of the Rindge Baseball team. From 1935 to 1946, Matthews played with several Negro League teams, mostly the Boston Royal Giants and the Newark Eagles and one game with the Kansas City Monarchs at Fenway Park in 1943. The wear of travel and the low salaries of the Negro Leagues got to Matthews forcing him to decide to return to Boston in 1942 to work at the Watertown Arsenal. He never left baseball though. Matthews starred as one of three black players on the Watertown Arsenal Boston Park League team for many years. Matthews served in the United States Armed Forces during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. While serving in Vietnam, Matthews was wounded by shrapnel in his leg and received a Purple Heart.</description>

      <description>Francis Birch (August 22, 1903 – January 30, 1992) was an American geophysicist. He is considered one of the founders of solid Earth geophysics. He is also known for his part in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. During World War II, Birch participated in the Manhattan Project, working on the design and development of the gun-type nuclear weapon known as Little Boy. He oversaw its manufacture, and went to Tinian to supervise its assembly and loading into Enola Gay, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress tasked with dropping the bomb. A graduate of Harvard University, Birch began working on geophysics as a research assistant. He subsequently spent his entire career at Harvard working in the field, becoming an Associate Professor of Geology in 1943, a professor in 1946, and Sturgis Hooper Professor of Geology in 1949, and professor emeritus in 1974. Birch published over 100 papers. He developed what is now known as the Birch-Murnaghan equation of state in 1947. In 1952 he demonstrated that Earth's mantle is chiefly composed of silicate minerals, with an inner and outer core of molten iron. In two 1961 papers on compressional wave velocities, he established what is now called Birch's law.</description>

      <description>Chicago (/ʃᵻˈkɑːɡoʊ/ or /ʃᵻˈkɔːɡoʊ/) is the third most populous city in the United States. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwest. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S. Chicago is the seat of Cook County. Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837, near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed, and grew rapidly in the mid-nineteenth century. The city is an international hub for finance, commerce, industry, technology, telecommunications, and transportation: O'Hare International Airport is the busiest airport in the world when measured by aircraft traffic; it also has the largest number of U.S. highways and rail road freight. In 2012, Chicago was listed as an alpha global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, and ranked seventh in the world in the 2014 Global Cities Index. As of 2014, Chicago had the third largest gross metropolitan product in the United States at US$610.5 billion. In 2014, Chicago had 50.2 million international and domestic visitors. Chicago's culture includes the visual arts, novels, film, theater, especially improvisational comedy, and music, particularly jazz, blues, soul, gospel and house music. It also has professional sports teams in each of the major professional leagues. Chicago has many nicknames, the best-known being the Windy City.</description>

      <description>A web hosting service is a type of Internet hosting service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies that provide space on a server owned or leased for use by clients, as well as providing Internet connectivity, typically in a data center. Web hosts can also provide data center space and connectivity to the Internet for other servers located in their data center, called colocation, also known as Housing in Latin America or France. The scope of web hosting services varies greatly. The most basic is web page and small-scale file hosting, where files can be uploaded via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or a Web interface. The files are usually delivered to the Web "as is" or with minimal processing. Many Internet service providers (ISPs) offer this service free to subscribers. Individuals and organizations may also obtain Web page hosting from alternative service providers. Personal web site hosting is typically free, advertisement-sponsored, or inexpensive. Business web site hosting often has a higher expense depending upon the size and type of the site. Single page hosting is generally sufficient for personal web pages. A complex site calls for a more comprehensive package that provides database support and application development platforms (e.g. ASP.NET, ColdFusion, Java EE, Perl/Plack, PHP or Ruby on Rails). These facilities allow customers to write or install scripts for applications like forums and content management. Also, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is typically used for websites that wish to keep the data transmitted more secure. The host may also provide an interface or control panel for managing the Web server and installing scripts, as well as other modules and service applications like e-mail. A web server that does not use a control panel for managing the hosting account, is often referred to as a "headless" server. Some hosts specialize in certain software or services (e.g. e-commerce, blogs, etc.).</description>

      <description>A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. Cities generally have complex systems for sanitation, utilities, land usage, housing, and transportation. The concentration of development greatly facilitates interaction between people and businesses, sometimes benefiting both parties in the process, but it also presents challenges to managing urban growth. A big city or metropolis usually has associated suburbs and exurbs. Such cities are usually associated with metropolitan areas and urban areas, creating numerous business commuters traveling to urban centers for employment. Once a city expands far enough to reach another city, this region can be deemed a conurbation or megalopolis. In terms of population, the largest city proper is Shanghai, while the fastest-growing is Dubai.</description>

      <description>The mayor–council government system is one of the two most common forms of local government in the United States. It is the one most frequently adopted in large cities, although the other form, council–manager government, is the typical local government form of more municipalities. Characterized by having a mayor who is elected by the voters, the mayor–council variant may be broken down into two main variations depending on the relationship between the legislative and executive branches, becoming a weak-mayor or a strong-mayor variation based upon the powers of the office. These forms are used principally in modern representative municipal governments in the United States, but also are used in some other countries.</description>

      <description>Rahm Israel Emanuel (/ˈrɑːm/; born November 29, 1959) is an American politician who serves as the 55th Mayor of Chicago. A member of the Democratic Party, Emanuel was elected in 2011, becoming Chicago's first Jewish mayor. He was reelected on April 7, 2015. Born in Chicago, Emanuel is a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College and Northwestern University. Working early in his career in Democratic politics, Emanuel was appointed as director of the finance committee for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. In 1993, he joined the Clinton administration, where he served as the Assistant to the President for Political Affairs and as the Senior Advisor to the President for Policy and Strategy before resigning in 1998. Beginning a career in finance, Emanuel worked at the investment bank Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. from 1998 for 2 1/2 years and served on the board of directors of Freddie Mac. In 2002, Emanuel ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives vacated by Rod Blagojevich, who resigned to become Governor of Illinois. Emanuel won the first of three terms representing Illinois's 5th congressional district, a seat he held from 2003 to 2009. During his tenure in the House, Emanuel held two Democratic leadership positions, serving as the Chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from 2005 to 2007 and as the Chair of the House Democratic Caucus from 2007 to 2009. After the 2008 presidential election, President Barack Obama appointed Emanuel to serve as White House Chief of Staff. In October 2010, Emanuel resigned as chief of staff to run as a candidate in Chicago's 2011 mayoral election. Because of questions over his eligibility to run for mayor, Emanuel's candidacy was initially rejected by the Illinois First District Appellate Court, though he was later found eligible to run in a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court of Illinois. Emanuel won with 55% of the vote over five other candidates in the nonpartisan mayoral election, succeeding 22-year incumbent Richard M. Daley. Although Emanuel did not obtain an absolute majority in the February 2015 mayoral election, he defeated Cook County Board Commissioner Jesús "Chuy" García in the April 7 runoff election. Since November 2015 Emanuel's approval rating has plunged in response to a series of scandals, most directly the police shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, the city's subsequent attempts to withhold a video of the shooting, and the lack of an investigation into the matter. In early December the federal Justice Department announced an investigation into the operations of the Chicago Police Department, a move which Emanuel initially opposed. By December over half of Chicagoans favored Emanuel's resignation, with highly critical evaluations of the mayor appearing in such sources as The New York Times and The New Yorker, and coming from such figures as the Reverend Al Sharpton.</description>

      <description>DuPage County is a county located in the U.S. state of Illinois. As of the 2010 census, the population was 916,924, making it the second-most populous county in Illinois. Its county seat is Wheaton. Dupage County is one of the collar counties of the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area. The majority of DuPage County is in the 630 and 331 area codes. However, the areas of the county that are in the city of Chicago are in area code 773, primarily part of O'Hare International Airport. Farmland and rolling plains cover most of DuPage County, while urban development thrives in some of the eastern parts of the county. Although the agricultural county is known mostly for its prosperous bean farming operations, residents (mostly in Clarendon Hills, Hinsdale, and Oak Brook) include some of the wealthiest people in the Midwest. In 2010, Hinsdale was voted the 2nd wealthiest town in the Midwest by Midwest Living, the first being Fairway, Kansas.</description>

      <description>Illinois (/ˌɪlᵻˈnɔɪ/ IL-i-NOY) is a state in the midwestern region of the United States. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. Although today the state's largest population center is around Chicago in the northern part of the state, the state's European population grew first in the west, with French Canadians who settled along the Mississippi River, and gave the area the name, Illinois. After the American Revolutionary War established the United States, American settlers began arriving from Kentucky in the 1810s via the Ohio River, and the population grew from south to north. In 1818, Illinois achieved statehood. After construction of the Erie Canal increased traffic and trade through the Great Lakes, Chicago was founded in the 1830s on the banks of the Chicago River, at one of the few natural harbors on southern Lake Michigan. John Deere's invention of the self-scouring steel plow turned Illinois' rich prairie into some of the world's most productive and valuable farmlands, attracting immigrant farmers from Germany and Sweden. Railroads carried immigrants to new homes, as well as being used to ship their commodity crops out to markets. By 1900, the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities and coal mining in the central and southern areas attracted immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. Illinois was an important manufacturing center during both world wars. The Great Migration from the South established a large community of African Americans in Chicago, who created the city's famous jazz and blues cultures. Three U.S. presidents have been elected while living in Illinois: Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Barack Obama. Additionally, Ronald Reagan, whose political career was based in California, was the only U.S. president born and raised in Illinois. Today, Illinois honors Lincoln with its official state slogan, Land of Lincoln, which has been displayed on its license plates since 1954. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum is located in the state capital of Springfield.</description>

      <description>Ezra Stoller (16 May 1915 – 29 October 2004) was an American architectural photographer. Stoller was born in Chicago. His interest in photography began while he was an architecture student at New York University, when he began making lantern slides and photographs of architectural models, drawings and sculpture. After his graduation in 1939, he concentrated on photography. His work featured landmarks of modern architecture, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building, Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, Alvar Aalto's Finnish Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair, and Eero Saarinen's last project Bell Labs Holmdel Complex. Stoller is often cited in aiding the spread of the Modern Movement. In 1961, he was the first recipient of a Gold Medal for Photography from the American Institute of Architects. Stoller's photographs are featured in the books Modern Architecture: Photographs by Ezra Stoller and Ezra Stoller, Photographer. In his later years, Stoller founded Esto Photographics, a commercial photography firm currently directed by his daughter Erica Stoller. Stoller's son Evan Stoller is an architect and designer of a line of architecturally influenced modern furniture called Stoller Works. He died in Williamstown, Massachusetts, on 29 October 2004, from complications of a stroke.</description>

      <description>John G. Fary (April 11, 1911 – June 7, 1984) was a U.S. Representative from Illinois. He represented the Illinois's 5th congressional district Born in Chicago, Illinois, Fary attended Saint Peter and Paul grammar school and graduated from Holy Trinity High School. His father was a tavern owner. He grew up in the "Back of the Yards"/McKinley Park neighborhood of Chicago's Southside. He attended Loyola University Chicago, Real Estate School of Illinois and Mid-West Institute. He served as member of Illinois general assembly from 1955 to 1975. In the legislature, he sponsored and co-sponsored bills to assist tavern owners and senior citizens and once sponsored a bill to raise the speed limit on Illinois highways to 80 miles an hour. The accomplishment he was most well known for was to relegalize the playing of Bingo for charitable purposes in the state of Illinois in 1971. This game had been outlawed as form of illegal gambling. Church and veterans' organizations had used the game as a source of revenue. His partner in this campaign was Republican W.J. "Bingo Bill" Murphy. He was a member of the Knights of Columbus, LaSalle General Assembly, Moose, Eagles, Kiwanis, Lions, Polish National Alliance, Polish Roman Catholic Union and Chamber of Commerce. His hobbies were fishing, hunting and golfing. He lived above a tavern he and his wife owned at 36th Street and Damen Avenue in the Back of the Yards neighborhood. He briefly marketed a brand of whiskey called "Bingo Bourbon" to commemorate the passage of the Bingo law. He was one of the organizers of "The Donkey Saurkraut Club". He was also an insurance and real estate broker. He would entertain children by making bunny rabbits out of a handkerchief and a could make a variety of bird calls from a blade of grass. Fary was elected as a Democrat to the Ninety-fourth Congress by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of U.S. Representative John Kluczynski and reelected to the three succeeding Congresses (July 8, 1975-January 3, 1983). He served on the Aviation Subcommittee and was instrumental in rebuilding Midway Airport. He was one of several congressmen who pursued federal funding for a flood control plan for the South Side called the Little Calumet Watershed Plan, which Congress eventually approved. He was defeated in the 1982 Democratic primary by Chicago Alderman Bill Lipinski. He was named 1978 National Citizen of the year by a Polish newspaper in Buffalo, NY. In 1982, a railway bridge on 67th and Cicero in the Southside of Chicago was named in his honor. He died in Chicago, Illinois, June 7, 1984 at Rush Presbyterian St Luke's Hospital. He was interred at Resurrection Cemetery, Justice, Illinois. The funeral procession of nearly 100 cars was escorted to the church by Chicago police. Seven Roman Catholic priests, led by Bishop Alfred Abramowicz, auxiliary bishop of Chicago and pastor of Five Holy Martyrs Church celebrated the requiem mass accompanied by the bishop's choir and violinists from the Civic Orchestra of Chicago. 250 mourners were in attendance.</description>

In the final series of the 1924 season, the Giants were playing the Philadelphia Phillies at the Polo Grounds and battling for the pennant with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 to throw the games. Sand rejected the bribe and reported it to Phillies manager Art Fletcher. It eventually led to the lifetime suspension of O'Connell and Dolan, who was a coach for the Giants, by Commissioner Landis, although future-Hall of Famers Frankie Frisch, George Kelly, and Ross Youngs were also implicated.</description>

Dr. Matijevic was involved in developing the "Sojourner", "Spirit", "Opportunity" and "Curiosity" rovers. For his contributions to the rover projects, NASA named several landmarks on the planet Mars (including "Matijevic Hill" and "Jake Matijevic" rock) after him. Dr. Matijevic was born and grew up in Chicago, Illinois and graduated from Mount Carmel High School. In 1969, he received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the Illinois Institute of Technology, and, in 1973, earned a Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the University of Chicago. In 1981, Dr. Matijevic began working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, as a control systems engineer. In 1986, he worked in the telerobotics field and later, in 1992, began work with the Mars "Sojourner" rover. This rover was delivered to Mars by the Pathfinder spacecraft in 1996. Afterwards, Dr. Matijevic helped develop the "Spirit" and "Opportunity" rovers that began exploring Mars in 2004. He also helped develop the "Curiosity" rover that landed on Mars in August 2012, just two weeks before his death. After his death, NASA decided to name a Mars hill, "Matijevic Hill", encountered by the "Opportunity" rover, and also a Mars rock, "Jake Matijevic", encountered by the "Curiosity" rover, in his honor for his many contributions to the Mars rover projects over the years.</description>

      <description>Patrick "Paddy" Quinn (August 1849 – January 2, 1909) was an American baseball player in the first professional league. He played catcher in five games for the 1871 Fort Wayne Kekiongas and he appeared in two other more major league seasons in the 1870s. Quinn was a regular league player during only one season, with three teams in 1875, primarily as a catcher. He led the Keokuk Westerns in batting average (.326) with 14 hits, working 11 of 13 games before that club went out of business. He moved on to Hartford and Chicago, 33 games in all. In the National League two seasons later, he returned to the Chicago White Stockings for four games in the outfield. Quinn was a Chicago native and he played there as an amateur at the dawn of the professional era. The National Association of Base Ball Players first permitted professional clubs in 1869 and the White Stockings were established as Chicago's first pro club one year later. Quinn played for Aetna of Chicago, a respectable member of the amateur class. Jimmy Hallinan also played for the Aetnas of Chicago in 1870, when both Hallinan and Quinn turned 21 years old during the baseball season. In 1871 they both played a few games for the Kekiongas of Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the next league experience for both was at age 26 with the Westerns of Keokuk, Iowa in 1875. Little is known about baseball in the 1870s, outside the leagues, but it seems that many clubs such as the Aetnas and their amateur or semipro rivals continued to operate, and thus adult players outside the leagues, such as Hallinan and Quinn before 1875, continued to play competitively. According to one obituary, Hallinan played four season for Aetna beginning 1870. Quinn died, aged 59, from unknown causes in his native Chicago in 1909.</description>

In 1955 he purchased a 1,500-acre (6.1 km2) Vasquez Rocks property to train animals, which he called Nature's Haven. He married Toni Ringo in 1963. They had a daughter, Tana Helfer. In 1963 the property was cut in half by the Antelope Valley Freeway. They relocated to Soledad Canyon. They bought 600 acres (2.4 km2) of land to build their new ranch and decided to name it Africa U.S.A. Africa U.S.A. was a training compound and a provider of animals for Hollywood (Clarence, the cross-eyed lion, and Judy the chimp in Daktari, and Ben (originally named Bruno) the bear in Gentle Ben). The compound was also used as location for shows such as Daktari and the original Star Trek episode "Shore Leave." " During these years, Helfer created what he called "affection training," which purported to replace the whip, gun, and chair of the old-school handlers with love, understanding, and respect. Critics state that affection training indeed consisted in surgically modifying (declawing and defanging) the animals and administering sedatives. Ralph Helfer denies this and stated that "this was done to animals that had deformities and were injurious to their health." In January 1969, Africa U.S.A. was devastated by a powerful storm over Soledad Canyon which dropped large amounts of rainfall in the region. This resulted in severe flooding and mudslides in the canyons. 9 of the 1,500 animals of the ranch were killed by the torrential flooding. Ralph Helfer bought out Marine World in 1972 when it went bankrupt and added a wildlife park and "jungle theater", renaming the park as Marine World/Africa U.S.A. This park was the predecessor of Six Flags Discovery Kingdom. He also was a partner and chairman in a small Buena Park, California, theme park called Enchanted Village which was built on the site of the defunct Japanese Village and Deer Park amusement attraction. When this park went bankrupt in fall 1977 he created another company and training park called "Gentle Jungle". The Gentle Jungle Affection Training School was based in Colton, California and later in Lion Country Safari, in Orange County; finally Gentle Jungle was investigated by USDA where an eventual lawsuit against Helfer for Animal Welfare Act violations. During this period he was the owner of the "human" chimp Oliver. Ralph Helfer was cleared of all accusations except one, which was sent to the supreme court, which was meant to deal with the death of a tiger, who died due to a veterinarian over dosing the tiger, it never got to the supreme court as that would be the same as blaming a child's death on a parent who took their child to a doctor who miss-administrated drugs to the child. Ralph Helfer left the business due to the imminent financial pressure of the wrongful suit. In 1981, he was the writer and producer of the adventure film Savage Harvest. In the 1990s, he began a successful career as writer. Most of his books tell are non fiction life stories of famous animals. He now lives in Los Angeles and Kenya, where he leads safari tours with his company Eden International Safaris and Treks. Toni Ringo Helfer (d. March 20, 2012) published the book The Gentle Jungle (Brigham Young University Press - 1980 - ISBN 0-8425-1790-1). She made the cover of TV Guide in 1968. Ralph and Toni are now divorced. Ralph Helfer's current wife is now Suzzi Mutua, who works with him as safari hostess at Eden International. Tana Helfer played the role of Kristie in Savage Harvest and was the subject of the book When you fight the tiger by Joan Hewett (Little, Brown and Company - 1984 - ISBN 0-316-35956-4).</description>

A classic con trick, he made at least $500,000 using this swindle during a five-month period at the Columbian Exposition of 1893 as one of many figures of the criminal underworld who attended the event.</description>

He attended the University of Chicago from 1933 to 1935, dropping out because of the Depression. He became an inventor and a millionaire developing patents for companies such as Honeywell and Bendix while living in Chicago and Santa Barbara, California. After being diagnosed with heart disease in 1957, he began searching for a treatment. Based on studies indicating that people in primitive cultures with primarily vegetarian lifestyles had little history of heart disease, he created a low-fat diet that was high in unrefined carbohydrates like vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains, along with a moderate aerobic exercise regime. His dietary and exercise regime, the Pritikin Diet, was published in a book co-authored by Patrick M. McGrady. It has been called one of the "gold standards of American dieting success." He established the Pritikin Longevity Center in 1976 and served as its director. Now called the Pritikin Longevity Center &amp; Spa, it offers controlled diet, counseling in lifestyle change, and exercise in a resort/spa-type setting. Pritikin also served as chairman of the Pritikin Research Foundation. In the early 1980s, he began to suffer severe pain and complications related to leukemia. He committed suicide on February 21, 1985.</description>
